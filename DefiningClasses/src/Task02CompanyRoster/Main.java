/**
 * Define a class Employee that holds the following information: name, salary, position, department, email, and age.
 * The name, salary, position, and department are mandatory while the rest are optional.
 *
 * Your task is to write a program that takes N lines of information about employees from the console
 * and calculates the department with the highest average salary and prints for each employee in that department
 * his name, salary, email, and age - sorted by salary in descending order.
 * If an employee does not have an email – in place of that field you should print "n/a" instead,
 * if he does not have an age – print "-1" instead.
 * The salary should be printed to two decimal places after the separator.
 *
 * Hint: you can define a Department class that holds a list of employees.
